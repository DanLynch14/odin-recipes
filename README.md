# odin-recipes

The aim of the project is to build a basic recipe website.

It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I will show my ability to organize and strcuture the pieces of my webiste. It will also show i have learned how to create a basic html boilerplate alongside paragraphing, images, headers etc.

I will also use hypertect refrences to link to other webpages within the website.
