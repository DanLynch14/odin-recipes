    <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon fine salt </li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
    <h4> Batter: </h4>
    <li> ¾ cup cornstarch </li>
    <li> 4 tablespoons blue cheese salad dressing </li>
    <li> 1 teaspoon white sugar </li>
    <li> ½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    <li> ¼ teaspoon salt </li>
